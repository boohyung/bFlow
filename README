Introduction
------------

hbflow is a flow that takes a verilog file and finds a sequence that best 
describes it. It is a program extracts a birthmark that tries to 
characterize a hardware design. Given a database. it will try and return 
a ranked order of the circuits that best describes it

Running hbflow
--------------

hbflow depends on the Yosys open synthesis tools as well as the python
library networkx. 


NOTE: 
 * File names for the verilog modules has to be the same name as top
 * Directory name should be the same name as the top module


Dependencies
------------
	1. Yosys synthesis tools for analyzing verilog files
	2. BeautifulSoup for xml parsing
	3. NetworkX for reading dot files produced by yosys tools
	4. Smith waterman python library (swalign)
	
	OPTIONAL:
	1. Autosave plugin for vim


Preprocess Verilog file database:
	1. Have a collection of existing verilog files
			A. Verilog in a directory has a .d extension
			B. The name of the verilog files should be the top module
			C. Have a file with the list of all the verilog files
	2. Run python preprocessDB.py <list of .v> <output xml file name>
	3. Outputs a xml file with the birthmark extracted


Monitor Verilog File:
	1. Run ./serverMain <port number> <database xml>
		A. This will read in the database and then listen for the client to connect
	2. Run python monitor.py <reference verilog> <server IP> <port>
	  A. This will monitor for changes in the reference design. 
		B. If using vim, install Autosave plugin to autosave reference
